    "\n",
    "To test models on all combinations of hyperparameters, you can first list out all of the values in a list of lists.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```CPP\n",
    "hyperparams = {\n",
    "    'n_estimators': [10, 20],\n",
    "    'max_depth': [2, 5],\n",
    "    'min_samples_leaf': [0.1, 0.2]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can generate a list like this:\n",
    "```CPP\n",
    "[[10, 20],\n",
    " [2, 5], \n",
    " [0.1, 0.2]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you can get all combinations of the hyperparameter values:\n",
    "```CPP\n",
    "[(10, 2, 0.1),\n",
    " (10, 2, 0.2),\n",
    " (10, 5, 0.1),\n",
    " (10, 5, 0.2),\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To feed the hyperparameters into an random forest model, you can use a dictionary, so that you do not need to hard code the parameter names.\n",

    "```CPP\n",
    "RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators= 20, max_depth=5, min_samples_leaf=0.2)\n",
    "```\n",

    "RandomForestClassifier(**args_d)\n",

    "\n",
    "So you'll find a way to generate a list of dictionaries, like this:\n",

    " {'n_estimators': 20, 'max_depth': 5, 'min_samples_leaf': 0.2}]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the values in both the list of tuples and list of dictionaries are in the same order as the original hyperparams dictionary.  For example, the first value in each is n_estimarors, then max_depth, and then min_samples_leaf:\n",
