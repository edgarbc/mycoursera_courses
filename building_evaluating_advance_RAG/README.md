# Materials from the course Building and Evaluating Advanced RAG

from DeepLearning.AI 

# Course description
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) stands out as one of the most popular use cases of large language models (LLMs). This method facilitates the integration of an LLM with an organization’s proprietary data.

To successfully implement RAG, it is essential to enhance retrieval techniques for obtaining coherent contexts and employ effective evaluation metrics.

In this course, we’ll explore:

Two advanced retrieval methods: Sentence-window retrieval and auto-merging retrieval that perform better compared to the baseline RAG pipeline. 
Evaluation and experiment tracking: A way evaluate and iteratively improve your RAG pipeline’s performance. 
The RAG triad: Context Relevance, Groundedness, and Answer Relevance, which are methods to evaluate the relevance and truthfulness of your LLM’s response.
